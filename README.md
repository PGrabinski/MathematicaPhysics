University Course: Symbolical and numerical computations in Physics
Supervision: dr hab. Krzysztof Graczyk

This course was a quite thorough introduction to Mathematica package by Wolfram.
At first, I was impressed by it, but then the syntax for functional programming made it awkward.
The problem is that the performance side of Mathematica is built upon the hard-to-read functional syntax.
